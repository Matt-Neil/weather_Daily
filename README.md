weatherDaily is a SPA created using reactJS and fetching data from [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/) and [https://www.weatherbit.io/](https://www.weatherbit.io/).

This weather app allows you to search for a city and/or country (for specificity) where the corresponding weather information is returned as the following: current weather at the moment of request, hourly weather until the end of the day from the moment of request and the daily weather 8 days from the moment of request starting with the current day.

You are also able to favourite commonly visited locations for convenience. All weather information is updated automatically when changing currently viewed city either via the favourites or recent sections, or manually. All weather information is restored and updated on a new session.
